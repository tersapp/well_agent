# Statistics Skill

This skill provides basic statistical capabilities for analyzing well log curves.

## Capabilities

### Find Extreme Values
- **Tool**: `find_extreme_values`
- **Purpose**: Identify the range of a curve, such as finding the cleanest sandstone (lowest Gamma Ray) or the tightest formation (highest Density).
- **Usage**:
    - "Find the minimum GR in the interval 2000-2050m"
    - "What is the highest porosity value?"
